## Welcome to PyTorch for Deep Learning

## Course Aims
This course aims to train students, with the specified prerequisites, to master [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/), a rising Deep Learning framework, to develop his/her own deep learning projects. This course also provides trainees with a brief introduction to deep learning algorithms. Upon completing this course, the trainee shall be able to construct a deep-learning project by using PyTorch code to solve real-world problems in various application domains.
